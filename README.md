# CRC-Code
The code in this repository was used for my dance capstone. There are two main files. SwapGroups/InBatch, and shuffleCorrupt.

SwapGroups was primarily used for generating the Computationally Random Choreography, shuffle corrupt was used in early development, but was migrated into SwapGroups for efficiency and a different style of shuffling.
